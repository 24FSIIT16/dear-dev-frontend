        <p>Your happiness scores are tied to four easily recognizable smileys that reflect your mood and represent:</p>
        <ul className="list-inside list-disc space-y-2">

            <span>20 points</span>
          </li>
          <li className="flex items-center space-x-2">
            <Smile className="h-8 w-8" />
            <span>14 points</span>
          </li>

          is currently in a test phase and will be adjusted as soon as the field testing is evaluated.
